# Profile Web Page

## Overview

Welcome to the Profile Web Page project! This repository contains the code for a modern and responsive profile web page. The profile page is built using HTML and CSS, and is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

##HTML Structure:

The HTML file contains the basic structure of the webpage, including the <header>, <main>, and <footer> sections.
Inside the header, we include a profile picture, a name, a description, and social media links with icons.
The main section includes skills, hobbies, and projects.

##CSS Styles:

Basic Styling: Sets up general styling such as font, colors, and spacing.
Header and Footer: Styles for the header and footer with background color, padding, and text alignment.
Responsive Design: Uses media queries to adjust the layout for smaller screens. For example, it reduces the size of the profile picture and social icons on smaller devices.

##Images and Links:

Replace profile.jpg, linkedin-icon.png, and github-icon.png with the actual paths to your images.
Update the href attributes in the social media links with your LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.
